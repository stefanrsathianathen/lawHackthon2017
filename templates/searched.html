        <p><i>With a population of over 1.3 billion, China has emerged as the world’s largest consumer market for food and beverage (F&B). Recent figures indicate that China is one of the fastest growing F&B markets in Asia, with an average annual growth rate of 35.4 per cent from 2011 to 2014. In 2016, the overall Chinese consumer expenditure for F&B products is expected to reach a total of US$976 billion.</i> </p>
        <p><i>
        Every year, a large amount of F&B imported into the country is either returned or destroyed due to lack of compliance or irregularity in food quality. This causes a significant loss to both the importing and exporting companies. In some cases, the import license may be revoked and the companies may be barred from future trade.
        Keeping in mind the high business risks involved, companies must stay abreast of the latest food regulations and ensure the conformity of the products to the necessary import procedures.</i>

                   Chinese officials announced that from January 1, it would require infant formula products to be registered with the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Bellamy's said it would not achieve registration in time, due to the extensive testing required by the CFDA. It is another blow for the former share market favourite, which has watched its share price plummet by about 60 per cent since December.

            <p>Bellamy's has revealed it has failed to have its products registered for sale in China, now that its manufacturing plant in Victoria is changing hands.
            It is another blow for the former share market favourite, which has watched its share price plummet by about 60 per cent since December.
            About 14 per cent, or $16 million worth, of the Tasmanian infant milk formula manufacturers' products are sold in China.
            Chinese officials announced that from January 1, it would require infant formula products to be registered with the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA).
            In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Bellamy's said it would not achieve registration in time, due to the extensive testing required by the CFDA.
            The regulatory change will see earnings hit from the first quarter of 2018.

            <p>Once the shipment arrives in China, the food products are inspected by Customs officials for review of relevant shipping documentation and labelling requirements. The CIQ sanitary certificate is issued only if the documents are complete. This certificate is issued for every shipment of product.
            If the shipment is missing any documents and custom seizes it, you may either provide a CIQ declaration or provide the missing documents. To obtain a CIQ declaration, you must provide the following documents: your business license, importing license, quota certificate, safety compliance declaration, an introduction to your company, and product information in detail.
            If you are exporting food products for the first time, the process is more complex though the procedure is relaxed after successive exports. However, AQSIQ officials may still inspect labels and samples in the following shipments.</p>

            <p>Of particular interest among food imports are organic food items. Once seen as a luxury food item, imported organic foods are an increasingly accessible option for a Chinese consumer base with a growing disposable income. The organic food market in China has tripled since 2007 to currently account for 1.01 percent of total food consumption, which is still lower than the 5 to 8 percent of the market in areas like Europe and the U.S. Current rough estimates for the market value of organic imports are around US$20 million, with consumers typically middle and upper class Chinese with children. In a consumer study carried out on 204 Chinese organic consumers in Beijing and Shanghai, 71 percent were ready to pay a premium of 20 to 50 percent for organic products. The top five reasons for buying organic were all related to food quality assurance.</p>

            <p> From October 2011, Chinese port officials have adopted a ‘case-by-case’ reporting system based on the entry of organic products. In other words, each batch of imported organic products shall be reported to the Certification Supervision department within three days after it has had an inspection and quarantine. Information being reported to this department includes inspection number, product name and quantity (weight), trading value, organic certificate number and the result of the inspection and quarantine.

            Organic products that have not been issued a Chinese organic certificate can be imported as conventional products after they have been modified and comply with the relevant regulations and standards. If this is not possible, these products shall be destroyed or re-exported.
